What is the purpose of the game?

The purpose of the game (Space Invaders) is to move across the bottom of the screen and shoot descending 'aliens' to prevent them from reaching the bottom of the screen.

What element(s) are controlled by the player?

The player controls the horizontal movement of its character as well as the ability to fire at the aliens.

What element(s) are controlled by the computer?

The computer controls the movement of the aliens, as well as the rate at which they fire toward the user's character. 

How does the player control their element?

The player controls the horizontal movement using A and D keys, and they use left-click to shoot at the aliens. 

How do the non-player controlled elements behave (movement, positions, randomness, etc)

The aliens move as a group, shifting horizontally one pixel at a time, and once it reaches one side of the screen, the aliens all shift one pixel down and begin moving toward the other side of the screen. The fire rate appears to be random. 

If you were to program this, what classes would you write?

I would write a class for the user's character, a class for the aliens, and possibly a class for the fire rate. 

If you were to program this, would you use an array for some parts? What kind of array? What would you be storing in it?

Yes, I would use an array for at least the aliens. It would be an array of objects each representing an individual alien, and I would store the size and movement for the aliens.
